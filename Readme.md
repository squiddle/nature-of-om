Nature Of Om
============

nature-of-om is an attempt to recreate [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com) with [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om) Components

**noo is nature-of-om** and will be shorter to type

I try to learn some Graphics Programming, Clojurescript and Om with this. 
Lots of boundaries of knowledge to move outward.


If someone can help me figure out correct bundling for processing, react-art/react-art-cljs to have this nice 
and tidy done with leiningen and lein-cljsbuild i would be grateful. Otherwise it stays like it is.


Running
-------

This project uses leiningen

 * launch web server in project directory e.g ``lein simpleton 9000`` for [lein-simpleton](https://github.com/tailrecursion/lein-simpleton) users
 * run ``lein cljsbuild auto`` to automatically rebuild everything
